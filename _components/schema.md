The RDL schema gives risk experts a single language to describe hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets. It gives datasets an underlying consistency that makes them highly interoperable and easily read by both people and machines. The schema also contains labels for key metadata fields, making it easier to identify datasets without relying on external files or descriptions.
