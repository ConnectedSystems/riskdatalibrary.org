title: The Project
description: The purpose of the risk data library project is to make disaster risk assessments more effective by making the data they depend on easier to find, work with and share. We are working to establish a system of components, resources and practices explicitly designed for the needs of disaster risk experts.

        The overarching goal of the risk data library project is to make working with risk data easier and more effective. We aim to provide a series of products that help people store, find, share and edit their risk data.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-padding-bottom">
        Each of these products addresses a different need and therefore delivers a unique value. More importantly, all of them are designed to work together as interconnected components in a single library system—designed specifically to work with risk data.

        Our objective is not to create a centralised collection of risk data, but to provide a global public good that enables teams and organisations to manage their own collections. However, because each individual library can be connected to others, one possible long-term outcome of this project is a global network of risk data libraries—essentially a single, large collection.
