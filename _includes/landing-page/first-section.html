        The overarching goal of the risk data library project is to make working with risk data easier and more effective. We aim to provide a series of products that help people store, find, share and edit their risk data. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-padding-bottom">
        Each of these products addresses a different need and therefore delivers a unique value. More importantly, all of them are designed to work together as interconnected components in a single library system—designed specifically to work with risk data. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our objective is not to create a centralised collection of risk data, but to provide a global public good that enables teams and organisations to manage their own collections. However, because each individual library can be connected to others, one possible long-term outcome of this project is a global network of risk data libraries—essentially a single, large collection.

      Two components of the risk data library system have been developed and are ready for public release—a schema for formatting risk data and a database for storing it.

        The range of language and formatting used in much of today's risk data is a large part of what makes it challenging to work with. The RDL schema addresses this providing a single language that describes hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled-loss data in a standard, logical manner. The consistency and stability this creates make schema-formatted datasets easy to understand, highly interoperable and machine-readable. The schema also classifies and stores key metadata, enabling users to easily identify datasets’ content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of the schema multiplies with each dataset it is applied to. Widespread adoption is key to unlocking its potential.  To support that, we have designed the schema to be flexible and easily extensible, and plan to continue its development with a series of iterative releases that extend the values, categories and dimensions it includes.

        The risk database has been developed to meet the need to better share data developed in risk assessments. Its architecture stores hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modeled loss datasets in the same environment, keeping data from the same analysis connected.  Teams and organisations will no longer need to store different types of risk data on separate databases, making it easier to locate for use in assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        API access is supported, making it easier to share risk datasets and laying the foundation for a network of databases that are able to be accessed via a single search.

        We have invited a small group of data and risk specialists such as yourself to look over these components prior to public release. There are three things we are hoping to achieve with this:
      </p>
      <ul class="list first-section-numeric-list first-section-line-height">
        <li>
          Flag any critical issues that would mean either component is not yet ready for public release.
        </li>
        <li>
          Better understand the range of application and potential audiences for each component.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify immediate and longer-term improvements.

        We are looking for your insights and suggestions on the following points:
      </p>
      <p class="title-color">
        The database
      </p>
      <ul class="list first-section-line-height">
        <li>
          How well the current structure is likely to meet the data storage needs of projects and organisations in the risk community, particularly those related to performing risk assessments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any reasons the current database design might become unstable or be otherwise ineffective over time or when dealing with large numbers of datasets and/or users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ways the current structure could be improved to make the database more efficient, or how it might be adapted to other roles within the risk community.
        </li>
        <li>
          Which data-export formats would best meet the needs of the risk community (we have limited export functionality to csv for the proof of concept).

        The schema
      </p>
      <ul class="list first-section-line-height">

          How well the current schema describes the four types of risk data.
        </li>
        <li>
          How well the current schema supports the information needs of risk assessments. Particularly whether it describes an appropriate range of metadata to enable risk experts to identify the datasets they need for a particular disaster risk assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any critical information that is not currently described in the schema, or any surplus information that could be removed without compromising the utility of the schema.
        </li>
        <li>
          How understandable the current schema is and anything that might make it easier for risk experts to understand it without having to rely on external legends or guides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Which metadata standards would best meet the needs of the risk community (we have not defined the standards to use, in the proof of concept).

          The types of roles, projects or organisations that would benefit the most from using them.

          Any <i>critical</i> issues that would mean either component is not ready to be publicly released.

        <li>
          What would encourage or discourage people to apply the schema to newly created data.

          Obstacles to widespread use, particularly any aspects of the schema or database themselves.
