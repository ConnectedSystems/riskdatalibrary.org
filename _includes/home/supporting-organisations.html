      The RDL project is the result of the collective effort and ongoing support of many institutions active in developing and using each component of risk data. 
      The project has brought together expertise from internationally-recognised research insitutions and established global partnerships with combined expertise across multiple hazards and 
      all aspects of risk assessment. 
      The partners develop and apply risk data in a variety of scales and contexts, providing a complete understanding of the challenges risk analysts face in finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments.
