        Solving the Puzzle - Innovating to reduce risk
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving the Puzzle provides a community perspective on priorities for future collaboration and investment in the development and use of disaster risk information for developing countries. The focus is on high-impact activities that will promote the creation and use of risk-related data, catastrophe risk models, and platforms, and that will improve and facilitate the understanding and communication of risk assessment results.

        What is the Risk Data Library?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Risk Data Library is a system for better managing risk data. Its components make working with risk data easier and create an effective library system designed explicitly for storing, finding, editing and exchanging data for disaster risk assessments. The two components are now available:
        The RDL schema is a new language for describing hazard, exposure, vulnerability and loss data. It gives risk experts a single language to describe datasets used in climate and disaster risk  assessment. The datasets have an underlying consistency that makes them highly interoperable, and key metadata fields tailored to risk analysis.
        The RDL database enables hazard, exposure, vulnerability and loss datasets to be stored in the same environment, consistent with the schema. It provides the architecture for searching and downloading the increasing number of datasets using the schema.

        Who is leading the Risk Data Library project?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Risk Data Library project is led by GFDRR Labs. The <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en" class="link" target="_blank">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)</a> is a global partnership that helps developing countries better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. 
        <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/gfdrr-labs" class="link" target="_blank">GFDRR Labs</a> uses cutting-edge science and technology to make high-quality risk information available faster and at lower costs, and develop new tools that allow decision-makers and communities to collect, share, and understand risk information. We tailor our approach to support the full range of disaster risk management interventions — from preparedness to risk reduction to consideration of financial solutions.

        Can I upload data on the Risk Data Library?
      </p>
      <p>
        Uploading data on riskdatalibrary.org is limited to GFDRR administrators. The Risk Data Library is not intended for public upload of data.
